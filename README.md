# Requirement
Python 3.9.18, Tensorflow (and Keras) 2.10.0, cvnn 2.0, Tensorflow Probability 0.18.0

# Results
To quantitatively measure the proposed DDF2Pol model, three evaluation metrics are employed to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, Overall Accuracy (OA), Average Accuracy (AA) and Cohen's Kappa (k). Also, Each class accuracy has been reported
